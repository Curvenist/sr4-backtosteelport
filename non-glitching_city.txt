Non-glitching city
by BadMadScientist
v. 1.0

This little tweak removes the effect of "pixelization" that show up on cars and pedestrians in Steelport simulation.

Installation:
Just move "tweak_table.xtbl" into Saints Row IV root folder ("...\Steam\SteamApps\common\Saints Row IV")

Merging instructions:
And if you would like to merge this tweak with some other mods, open requested tweak_table.xtbl and change "Glitch_effect_lifetime" value to 0 (line 425).

Have fun!
