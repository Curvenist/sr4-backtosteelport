### üëó Clothing & Animation Fixes

- ‚úÖ **Barista Outfit**: fixed height alignment so heels no longer clip through surfaces

  - SMG-Storm

---

### ü•ã Animation & Finisher Tweaks

- ‚úÖ **Super nutshot** finishers replaced by 3 melee takedowns from *Saints Row: The Third*  
  ‚Üí More grounded and aggressive close-combat sequences.

- ‚úÖ **Sprint finishers** reworked:
  - **Front sprint**: replaced with *Diving Clothesline*

- ‚úÖ **Combo melee sequence updated**:

---

### üß† NPC & Ally Behavior

- ‚úÖ **Morningstar gang**: reassigned to *Saints Soldier* faction (appear as allies)  
- ‚úÖ **Ally loadouts**:
  - Pistol loadouts removed for most allies  
  - Allies now more frequently carry assault-type weapons:
    - Rifle-NG, Rifle-Gang, and SMG-Gang  
- ‚úÖ **Outfit changes** for key characters:
  - Kinzie, Pierce, and Asha now wear their **presidential outfits** for super homies. Matt wears his SR3 model for his super homie version. 
  - Saints **Tanya** model replaced with **Viola**
- ‚úÖ **Clone Army spawns only Morningstars**:  
  - Now equipped with firearms (instead of unarmed/melee loadouts like in vanilla)

---

### üö® Notoriety System Overhaul

Starting from **Act 3 (Final Act)**, the alien faction has been **fully replaced** in the notoriety system by classic human enemies from *Saints Row: The Third*:

- ‚úÖ **Enemy waves** now include factions such as:
  - **Police** (with SWAT units, riot shields, and tactical gear)
  - **Morningstar**
  - **Steelport National Guard** (heavy military ordnance)
  - **STAG** (equipped with energy weapons and shields)
  - **Deckers**

- ‚úÖ **Vehicles** used by each faction match their identity and era, including faction-themed cars, APCs, and aircraft when appropriate.

- ‚úÖ **Wave spawns**:
  - Each notoriety level triggers **portal spawns** that start with *Saints reinforcements* before enemies arrive.
  - Factions are not allied: **expect crossfire** between gangs, law enforcement, and STAG.

- ‚úÖ **Wave composition per notoriety level**:

| Notoriety Level | Enemy Factions                                  |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Level 2          | Police, National Guard                          |
| Level 3          | Morningstar, Police                             |
| Level 4          | Deckers, STAG                                   |
| Level 5          | Police, Military, Morningstar, Deckers, STAG   |

This rework transforms the final arc of the game into a *Steelport flashback scenario*, delivering a more grounded and chaotic late-game combat loop.
